<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jfries/"> Jason Fries</a> is a research scientist at Stanford University, working on training and evaluating multimodal foundation models for healthcare.  His  research focuses on training and evaluating foundation models for healthcare and is positioned at the intersection of computer science, medical informatics, and hospital systems. Much of his work explores using electronic health record (EHR) data to contextualize human health, leveraging longitudinal patient information to inform model development and evaluation.
